        <p>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Never let anyone know what you are thinking. Don't you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? I see you took the name of the town. What was your father's name? My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out.</p>
